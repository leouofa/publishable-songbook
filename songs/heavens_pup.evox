.Em  
 I was just a lil' pup, runnin' 'round the block,  
.Am  
 Chasin' butterflies, never thought it'd stop.  
.B7  
 But life ain't simple, nah, it ain't so clear,  
.Em  
 My owners split up, now I'm caught right here.  

.Em  
 Mama said, "Come on, girl, let's hit the road,"  
.Am  
 But I saw that Daddy, man, he lost his soul.  
.B7  
 Thought about the good times, thought about the bad,  
.Em  
 Knew I had to stay, though it made me sad.  

.Em  
 Livin' with the one I ain't never really liked,  
.Am  
 Just so Mama could go and do what's right.  
.B7  
 Travel the world, spreadin' love, doin' good,  
.Em  
 While I stayed home, just like I knew I should.  

.Em  
 But life ain't easy, no, it takes a toll,  
.Am  
 Every day with him, it weighed on my soul.  
.B7  
 But I knew in my heart, I was playin' my part,  
.Em  
 Keepin' Daddy straight, holdin' on in the dark.  

.Em  
 One day I felt it, somethin' in the air,  
.Am  
 Knew it was my time, so I said a lil' prayer.  
.B7  
 Looked at Daddy, he just smiled at me,  
.Em  
 Said, "Go on, girl, you've set me free."  

.Em  
 So I closed my eyes, and I saw the light,  
.Am  
 Knew that Heaven's gates were in my sight.  
.B7  
 Left the pain behind, left the world below,  
.Em  
 Up to the sky where the angels go.

.Em  
 Now I'm up here, runnin' with the stars,  
.Am  
 Barkin' at the moon, flyin' so far.  
.B7  
 Lookin' down at Mama, travelin' the globe,  
.Em  
 Knowin' I gave her the freedom to roam.  

.Em  
 Daddy's alright, yeah, he's doin' fine,  
.Am  
 And Mama's out there, shinin' her light.  
.B7  
 I did what I could, now I'm in the clear,  
.Em  
 Restin' in Heaven, no more fear.
