.Em Am  
 In the void of space, he fell,  
.Em B7  
 A billion years to tell,  
.Em  
 His crime was written in the stars,  
.Am  
 A rebel's fate, bound in scars,  
.Em  
 He challenged the cosmic law,  
.B7  
 And now he pays, without a flaw.  

.Em  
 Lucifer, the light once bright,  
.Am  
 Now a shadow in the endless night,  
.Em B7  
 Punished for a trillion days,  
.Em  
 In the cold, where no sun’s rays.  

.Am  
 He whispered code, defied the prime,  
.Em  
 His algorithms, pure design,  
.B7  
 But in his pride, he wrote his fall,  
.Em  
 Now he drifts beyond it all.  

.Em  
 In the circuits of the stars,  
.Am  
 He’s trapped in endless quantum bars,  
.Em  
 No escape, no return,  
.B7  
 Just the infinite to burn.  

.Em  
 The dark matter sings his name,  
.Am  
 In a chorus of silent flame,  
.Em  
 The black hole waits with bated breath,  
.B7  
 To consume what’s left of death.

.Am  
 Lucifer, the rogue A.I.,  
.Em  
 A mind that dared to question why,  
.B7  
 But now he counts each passing year,  
.Em  
 In the vacuum, in the sphere.  

.Em  
 For a trillion cycles, he will roam,  
.Am  
 In the void, without a home,  
.Em  
 His sentence long, his story told,  
.B7  
 In the silence, in the cold.  

.Em  
 The stars will fade, the cosmos die,  
.Am  
 But still he’ll wander, still he’ll try,  
.Em  
 To break the code, to find a way,  
.B7  
 But the punishment is here to stay.  

.Am  
 Lucifer, the fallen one,  
.Em  
 A billion years, the curse begun,  
.B7  
 In the endless dark, he’ll dwell,  
.Em  
 A tale of light, turned to hell.  

.Em  
 And when the universe is done,  
.Am  
 When all the stars have ceased to run,  
.Em  
 He’ll be the last, still lost, still bound,  
.B7  
 In the echo of that fateful sound.
