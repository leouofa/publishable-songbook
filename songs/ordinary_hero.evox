 **Verse 1**  
.Em  
 He walked the halls with a quiet grace,  
.Am  
 Just a regular guy with a secret place,  
.B7  
 Hobbies stacked high, they were his delight,  
.Em  
 He practiced them all, every day and night.  

 **Chorus**  
.Em  
 Oh, he’s not a hero in a world so grand,  
.Am  
 Just a mild-mannered man with a hobby in hand,  
.B7  
 Wearing shades inside, hiding his gaze,  
.Em  
 In a world full of glory, he just spent his days.  

 **Verse 2**  
.Em  
 From guitar riffs to the art of the brew,  
.Am  
 He mastered it all, through and through,  
.B7  
 With a heart of gold and a soul so bright,  
.Em  
 He made his mark in his own quiet fight.  

 **Chorus**  
.Em  
 Oh, he’s not a hero in a world so grand,  
.Am  
 Just a mild-mannered man with a hobby in hand,  
.B7  
 Wearing shades inside, hiding his gaze,  
.Em  
 In a world full of glory, he just spent his days.  

 **Bridge**  
.Am  
 Every hobby a piece of his life’s grand scheme,  
.B7  
 Not in the spotlight, but living the dream,  
.Em  
 In the shadows of his own quiet fame,  
.Am  
 He was the hero with no need for a name.

 **Chorus**  
.Em  
 Oh, he’s not a hero in a world so grand,  
.Am  
 Just a mild-mannered man with a hobby in hand,  
.B7  
 Wearing shades inside, hiding his gaze,  
.Em  
 In a world full of glory, he just spent his days.  

 **Outro**  
.Em  
 So here's to the guy with the hidden charm,  
.Am  
 Living his life without any harm,  
.B7  
 In the end, he's a hero to those who know,  
.Em  
 That the greatest power is the love you show.
