 ## Verse 1

.Em
 Yo, I started from the bottom, not a rhyme to my name,  
.Am
 Strugglin’ through the hustle, just a pawn in the game,  
.B7
 No freestyle flow, just a scribbler on the beat,  
.Em
 Life's on the line, can't retreat, can't accept defeat.

 ## Chorus

.Em
 Gotta spit fire, gotta show 'em my might,  
.Am
 Turn these bars into bullets, make 'em run from the fight,  
.B7
 Freestyle's my weapon, I ain't playin’ no games,  
.Em
 These rhymes are so lethal, they should fear my name.

 ## Verse 2

.Em
 Once was a novice, couldn't even catch a beat,  
.Am
 Now my words are sharp, and my rhythm's on repeat,  
.B7
 Trained in the dark, now I'm sparkin' up the night,  
.Em
 Enemies approach, but they ain't ready for this fight.

 ## Chorus

.Em
 Gotta spit fire, gotta show 'em my might,  
.Am
 Turn these bars into bullets, make 'em run from the fight,  
.B7
 Freestyle's my weapon, I ain't playin’ no games,  
.Em
 These rhymes are so lethal, they should fear my name.

 ## Bridge

.Am
 When the mic's in my hand, I’m a lyrical assassin,  
.B7
 Every word’s a blade, each line's a reaction,  
.Em
 They thought they could take me, but they underestimated,  
.Am
 The power of my freestyle, now their fate's been created.

 ## Chorus

.Em
 Gotta spit fire, gotta show 'em my might,  
.Am
 Turn these bars into bullets, make 'em run from the fight,  
.B7
 Freestyle's my weapon, I ain't playin’ no games,  
.Em
 These rhymes are so lethal, they should fear my name.

## Outro

.Em
 From a zero to a hero, I’ve mastered the art,  
.Am
 My freestyle's my shield, my weapon, my heart,  
.B7
 They came for my life, but they’re leavin' in fright,  
.Em
 ‘Cause my rhymes are so dangerous, I won this fight.
