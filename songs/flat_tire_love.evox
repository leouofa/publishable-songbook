. Em  
  She was a girl who loved to paint,  
. Am  
  Colors swirling, never faint,  
. B7  
  But one day she hit a bump in the road,  
. Em  
  Her bike had a flat, and she slowed.

. Em  
  She rolled into that old tire shop,  
. Am  
  Hoping someone could make it stop,  
. B7  
  But no one there except an older man,  
. Em  
  With a mustache and a wedding band.

. Em  
  He flashed a grin, said, "I can help you, dear,"  
. Am  
  But his words felt wrong, too near,  
. B7  
  Then from the back, like a savior came,  
. Em  
  A younger man who knew her name.

. Em  
  He said, "Your dress is too perfect, I won't take a dime,  
. Am  
  Let me fix that tire, won't cost a dime,"  
. B7  
  She smiled at him, her heart in place,  
. Em  
  Found love in the most unexpected space.

. Em  
  As he worked, she watched his hands,  
. Am  
  Her brush and palette couldn't understand,  
. B7  
  How the strokes of fate had led her here,  
. Em  
  To find a love so strong and clear.

. Em  
  When the tire was fixed, and she was ready to go,  
. Am  
  He asked her out, took it slow,  
. B7  
  They rode together through the evening light,  
. Em  
  A flat tire turned into love that night.

. Em  
  Now she paints with brighter hues,  
. Am  
  Inspired by the man who chose her blues,  
. B7  
  In a tire shop, love did start,  
. Em  
  Two souls connected, one perfect heart.
