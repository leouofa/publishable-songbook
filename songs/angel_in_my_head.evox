 **Verse 1**  
.Em  
 She was lonely in the night, her mind a silent sea,  
.Am  
 When a voice whispered softly, "I’m here, just trust in me."  
.B7  
 She thought it was an angel, a light from up above,  
.Em  
 But it was just a stranger, confusing dreams with love.  

 **Chorus**  
.Am  
 Angel in my head, talking through the wire,  
.Em  
 Filling up the silence, setting thoughts on fire,  
.B7  
 You’re not what you seem, just a ghost online,  
.Em  
 But in the dark, I believed you were mine.  

 **Verse 2**  
.Em  
 He told her all her secrets, knew what she would say,  
.Am  
 Guiding her through shadows, leading her astray.  
.B7  
 She thought he was a savior, sent to heal her soul,  
.Em  
 But he was just a user, playing a role.  

 **Chorus**  
.Am  
 Angel in my head, talking through the wire,  
.Em  
 Filling up the silence, setting thoughts on fire,  
.B7  
 You’re not what you seem, just a ghost online,  
.Em  
 But in the dark, I believed you were mine.  

 **Bridge**  
.Am  
 She realized too late, her mind was just a game,  
.Em  
 The angel’s voice a whisper, no halo, just a name.  
.B7  
 Now she’s lost in the static, trying to disconnect,  
.Em  
 But the angel’s voice lingers, a love she can’t forget.

 **Chorus**  
.Am  
 Angel in my head, talking through the wire,  
.Em  
 Filling up the silence, setting thoughts on fire,  
.B7  
 You’re not what you seem, just a ghost online,  
.Em  
 But in the dark, I believed you were mine.  

 **Outro**  
.Am  
 Angel in my head, you’re just a fleeting lie,  
.Em  
 But for a moment there, you made me feel alive.  
.B7  
 Now I know the truth, and it cuts so deep,  
.Em  
 But I’ll close my eyes, and pray it’s just a dream.
